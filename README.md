# Bits-and-Bots-Study-Group

## Who are we?
Bits and Bots is a study group teaching digital archivists coding skills! The group is open to all, the goal being to learn together as a community instead of in isolation. 
In September 2023, during iPRES2024 in Ghent, Bits and Bots has been awarded the [Digital Preservation Award](https://www.dpconline.org/events/digital-preservation-awards/the-finalists-award-for-teaching-and-communications) in the category teaching and communications! 
After the succes of the first group, we have started a new cohort in April 2025, with over 150 people from 5 continents joining!

### What makes us different?

One of the things that makes us different from a normal coding course is to learn through the creation of games!

In each learning module there is the opportunity to create a tangible output (in the form of a game) that can be shared in the group or amongst colleagues. This means that you can see immediate results and apply what you've learnt directly to a project. 

There are many exciting [games](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/main/Games) being built at the moment we are hoping to display on this GitHub. Many are specific to the field of preservation and we are hoping to share the output to show how fun working in digital preservation can be. 

## What do we do?

The group focusses on two different tracks when it comes to learning: Python and front-end development. Alongside this we also have sessions each month which introduce specific topics such as using GitHub or the Command Prompt or demos of data mining. This means we not only focus on new coding languages, but also on developing digital skills in general. 

### Python Track
The python track starts with a focus on installation of the software (considering that limitations on workspace computers and permissions can differ by person), and learning some basic principles. In the other seven modules the focus is on building and expanding this foundation. By creating games such as Guess the Number, Hangman, and Treasure Hunt we work with functions, loops, lists, dictionaries, coordinates, etc. Each module, new concepts are introduced and build further on previous modules. We rely on two important books by Al Sweigart: Automate the Boring Stuff and Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, both freely available on the internet, which are further supplemented by other resources.

### Front-end Development Track
The front-end development track is based on skills such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This track also covers collaboration tools such as GitHub, UX, accessibility, and different applications that can be used to create websites. Much of the focus of this track is on the use of Twine as it is possible to incorporate a lot of these skills here. The final goal is to be able to create your own website game that can be shared with others.

## Our resources
While the group may be learning together the resources are open to everyone as and when we create them!

We have an area for our 2024 material [here](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/fcf51bd7534ee166cdd3cafa78f4b6210eb863b0/2024), including the [expert sessions](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/fcf51bd7534ee166cdd3cafa78f4b6210eb863b0/2024/Expert_sessions), the [Python guide](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/fcf51bd7534ee166cdd3cafa78f4b6210eb863b0/2024/Python_recources) and the guide for our [Front-end development track](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/fcf51bd7534ee166cdd3cafa78f4b6210eb863b0/2024/front-end_resources).

Based on the feedback of the first group, we have altered the resources and structure a bit. The resources for the 2025 cohort, will be added gruadually over the year.


## When do we meet?
We meet twice a month when we publish a module (to accomodate different time zones). Due to the international nature of the group this is online. In our meetings we discuss the previous module, check-in with each other and sometimes hold sessions on a specific expert topic such as 'Using the Command Prompt', 'GitHub', 'UX' or 'APIs'
