# Introduction to File Formats

In January 2026 we hosted an expert session on identifying file formats and recorded the talk which can be found online [here](https://youtu.be/E27E3jPysZ0)

The topic covered specific tools and the differences between them, such as [DROID (Digital Record Object Identification)](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/) and [Siegfried](https://www.itforarchivists.com/).

### Why is this useful?

1. Preservation: You cannot preserve a file if you don't know what it is. Identification is the first step in digital archiving.
2. Security: Malware often hides by masquerading as a harmless file type (e.g., an .exe renamed to .jpg). Identification tools look at the binary signature, not just the file extension.
3. Troubleshooting: When a file won't open, it is often because the extension doesn't match the actual format.

### Pre-requisites

For this session it might be useful if you have access to a few tools.

1.	A Hex Editor

You need a tool to view the raw binary data of a file, here are some tools that you can use, and others are available.
Windows: [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
macOS: [Hex Fiend](https://hexfiend.com/)
Linux: GHex or Bless

2.	An Identification Tool
These exercises will focus on [DROID (Digital Record Object Identification)](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/) and [Siegfried](https://www.itforarchivists.com/). Siegfried has a more accessible command line interface whilst DROID can be more approachable with a GUI. 


3.	Access to sample files
We have placed some sample files in the [Bits and Bots repository](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group/tree/main/2025/Introduction_to_File_Formats/File_Samples), GitHub is also an excellent resource for downloading sample files or you may already have some files sets that you wish to analyze on your computer.

## Exercises

### Analyse Your Files

### Research a File Format

### Optional Python Challenge
