# GitHub Guide 
This GitHub Guide is based on the expert session of the Bits and Bots study group, the 2025 cohort. 
It will cover the basic concepts, explain what GitHub is, and how to use it. 

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of file changes. It is also possible to track who made the changes. This makes Git perfect for working with others in writing
code for example. Git is used on platforms such as GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. Git and GitHub are two different things.
To learn more about Git, follow the [online course on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp).

### What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform that allows anyone to create, store, manage, and share content.
Oftentimes this is code. But that is not the only thing present in GitHub. Here are some
other use cases for GitHub:
* Software development
* Educational resources
* Fanfiction
* Reading lists
* Zines
* Datasets
* Community/crowdsourcing projects
* Blog posts
* Finding file samples
* Documentation

So why is GitHub great to use? GitHub allows people to work collaboratively on any project, with tracking and control settings favouring non-linear workflows and multiple contributions at a time. By tracking everything, there is also a lot of data integrity. 
Additionally, you can use GitHub to let the developers know you have an issue/something is not working.

To start, read more about GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git). One thing to bear in mind is that GitHub, while it is an amazing tool, does come with a lot of jargon. 
A great explanation for some of the terminology around GitHub can be found in this guide.

As digital archivists, we often use open-source tools to aid us with e.g. identifying and validating digital objects or harvesting websites. 
Here are some useful examples of GitHub repositories used in the field that you can find:
* https://github.com/openpreserve/jhove
*  https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid
*   https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler
*    https://github.com/noord-hollandsarchief (see the repositories in this account)

There are a lot of people working with digital archives that use GitHub. This is the reason that it is important for everyone to learn how to use it. Additionally, to show you that it is not just a scary programmer platform. 
A full introductory tutorial on GitHub can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).

### Introduction to GitHub Terminology
A great resource for finding GitHub terminology can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary). 
However, for the purposes of this guide, here is a quick table of basic terms that may help: 
|Term | Definition |
|:---|:-----------|
|**Repository**|A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.|
|**Issue**| Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion thread. You can also categorise an issue with labels and assign it to someone.|
|**Commit**|A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.|
|**Branch**|A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.|
|**Fork**|A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.|
|**Push**|To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.|
|**Pull**|Pull refers to when you are fetching changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.|
|**Markdown**|Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website.|
